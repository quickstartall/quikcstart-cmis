# Prerequisite
1. JDK 8 (lower version is also OK but I'm using JDK8)
2. Maven 3.2.5 (May work with other versions as well)
3. Internet connectio - It's required to download all necessary artifacts automatically.
4. Eclipse (Optional). it's required if you want to play around the code.

# Steps involved
1. Install and set up Maven and JDK (here is a guide: https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)
2. Clone/Download the project
3. Open command prompt and go to the project root directory. 
4. Exceute command mvn clean install
5. execute mvn eclipse:eclipse 
6. Import the project to Eclipse as maven project (example: http://javapapers.com/java/import-maven-project-into-eclipse/)
7. Run the main class "TestAlfrescoOperations" (In Eclipse Right click on the file TestAlfrescoOperations.java ==> Run As ==> Java Application) 
(Note- alternatively you can run the main class using maven as well if you wish)
8. You will see log in the console of eclipse. 
9. You can play around the code. Code is self explanatory. Proper cComments are addedd in the source code itself. 
10. That's all. Happy learning !
